# Introducing FoxBot

If a fox was a robot it would be fantastic. This is your very own personal robot, because you are fantastic. FoxBot is your AI-free personal assistant, diligently doing your chores in the background and letting you know about things important to you.

## What Can It Do?

* Poll your RSS feeds and notify you of relvent topics
* Detect changes to websites you care about
* Daily reminders throughout the day about things to be mindful of, like drinking water
* Countdown timers

## How Do I Run It?

You can run this wherever you like. Just download the appropriate binary from [here](https://github.com/antfie/FoxBot/releases/latest).

## What Does It Look Like?

In the console you would see something like this:
